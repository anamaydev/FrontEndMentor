## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights into various CSS techniques. I explored hover effects, which allowed me to enhance user interaction by changing the cursor to a pointer when hovering over elements. This small detail significantly improved the user experience by providing clear visual feedback.

Additionally, I developed my skills in Flexbox, which empowered me to create responsive and flexible layouts with ease. This newfound confidence in using Flexbox has equipped me to tackle more complex designs in future projects. Overall, this project has strengthened my understanding of CSS and its impact on web design.
