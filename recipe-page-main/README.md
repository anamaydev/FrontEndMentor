## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learned that `+` represents an adjacent sibling, it selects an element that is immediately next to another element. `ol > li + li`, it means "select every `<li>` that is directly after another `<li>` inside an `<ol>`." The two elements must be siblings (have the same parent), and the second one must immediately follow the first.

### Useful resources
