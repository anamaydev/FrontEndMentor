## Overview

### The challenge

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [GSAP](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/) - JavaScript Animation library


### What I learned
I was worried that declaring a global variable would let any script access it, causing security issues.
Then I learned about JavaScript closures, which help protect variables.
